# NoeticEvarobotFiles
Contains some modified packages and files for evarobot development

Relevant files that I changed for my Evarobot project are:

avoider.py. This is inspired by https://github.com/Rad-hi/Obstacle-Avoidance-ROS and I have made some changes to add additional subscribing, escape behavior, and logic. 


teleop_twist_keyboard.py. Teleop originally comes from https://github.com/ros-teleop
